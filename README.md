# Gridbox
**A fun app to experience Conway's Game of Life from a new perspective!**

## Customization:
- Change the **neighboorhood size**, which is the radius in which a pixel tests if it's alive or dead for the next generation
- Change the game speed, which is how fast each generation updates
- Change the ranges for survival and reproduction which makes it easier or harder for cells to exist
### And a secret thing in the bottom left corner
